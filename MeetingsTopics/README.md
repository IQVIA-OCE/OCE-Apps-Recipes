# Meeting Topics

Meetings have some custom screens which at times require some custom work by clients. These changes might not be aligned with the product roadmap of Meetings or might not be a part of the near-term plan for development.

The Meeting Topics app simulates the Meeting Topic screen in the Meetings component with some functionality in the product screens of the Meeting which can be used as an accelerator to build own custom functionality.<br />

**Supported device type:** iPad, iPhone
